                    Bees are winged insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in
                    the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. Bees are a
                    monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea. They are presently considered a clade, called
                    Anthophila. There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. Some
                    species including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies while most
                    species (>90%) including mason bees, carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, and sweat bees are solitary.
                </p>
                <span class="page-header">Types</span>
                <p>
                    Bees are found on every continent except for Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains
                    insect-pollinated flowering plants. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae,
                    or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Bees range in size from tiny
                    stingless bee species, whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long, to Megachile pluto, the
                    largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54 in).
                </p>
                <span class="page-header">Food</span>
                <p>
                    Bees feed on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for
                    protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for their larvae. Vertebrate predators of bees
                    include primates and birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.
                </p>
                <span class="page-header">Pollination</span>
                <p>
                    Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially, and the decline in wild bees has
                    increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees. The analysis of 353 wild
                    bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a
                    quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.
                </p>
                <span class="page-header">Beekeeping</span>
                <p>
                    Human beekeeping or apiculture (meliponiculture for stingless bees) has been practised for millennia,
                    since at least the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Bees have appeared in mythology and
                    folklore, through all phases of art and literature from ancient times to the present day, although
                    primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere where beekeeping is far more common. In Mesoamerica, the
                    Mayans have practiced large-scale intensive meliponiculture since pre-Columbian times.

                We are a local family company from the village of Antwood Crossing, UK. We have been operating since 1873,
                when our ancestor Mauvin Greene constructed his first beehive out of salvaged wood planks and crooked nails
                found by the road. Since then our family has developed its apiary into what it is now: a 200-acre, blooming
                field of over 800 beehives that are being taken care of by 153 dedicated and knowledgeable
                beekepers.<br><br>
