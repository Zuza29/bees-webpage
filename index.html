            <p>
                Bees are winged insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in
                the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. Bees are a
                monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea. They are presently considered a clade, called
                Anthophila. There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. Some
                species – including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees – live socially in colonies while most
                species (>90%) – including mason bees, carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, and sweat bees – are solitary.
            </p>
            <span class="page-header">Types</span>
            <p>
                Bees are found on every continent except for Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains
                insect-pollinated flowering plants. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae,
                or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Bees range in size from tiny
                stingless bee species, whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long, to Megachile pluto, the
                largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54 in).
            </p>
            <span class="page-header">Food</span>
            <p>
                Bees feed on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for
                protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for their larvae. Vertebrate predators of bees
                include primates and birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.
            </p>
            <span class="page-header">Pollination</span>
            <p>
                Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially, and the decline in wild bees has
                increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees. The analysis of 353 wild
                bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a
                quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.
            </p>
            <span class="page-header">Beekeeping</span>
            <p>
                Human beekeeping or apiculture (meliponiculture for stingless bees) has been practised for millennia,
                since at least the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Bees have appeared in mythology and
                folklore, through all phases of art and literature from ancient times to the present day, although
                primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere where beekeeping is far more common. In Mesoamerica, the
                Mayans have practiced large-scale intensive meliponiculture since pre-Columbian times.

        <h1>How to help bees?</h1>

        <p>
        Bees are pollinators and play a critical role in healthy ecosystems, so are essential for our food production.
        Pollinators are worth a staggering £690 million per annum to the UK economy, and more than three quarters of the world’s
        food crops are in part dependent on them. Yet, bee populations are suffering.
        
        Here in the UK, habitat loss and fragmentation combined with climate change are having huge impacts on bee populations.
        In East Anglia – 17 species have gone regionally extinct and many others are at risk. Local biodiversity is being
        negatively affected by the changing climate, and bees are being badly hit.
        </p>

        <span class="page-header">1. Grow your bee friendly garden</span>
        <p>
        Plant a range of flowers in your garden so bees have access to nectar from March to October. You can use the winter
        season to plan a garden full of nectar-rich plants that bees can forage come spring. Bees love traditional cottage
        garden flowers and native wildflowers, like primrose, buddleia, and marigolds.
        
        If you have space, leave a section of the garden untended – as some bees love long grass, or making nests in compost
        heaps or under hedgerows. Bees love large drifts of the same flowers. And they look spectacular as well!
        
        You can also buy (or easily build) an ‘insect hotel’ using hollow stems like bamboo, twigs and string – just tie
        together a length of these and put them in a hedge or bush, or hang somewhere sheltered to provide a home for bees and
        other insects.
        </p>
        
        <span class="page-header">2. Treat your buzzing friends to some sugar and let it 'bee'</span>
        <p>
        A tired bee really does like a tiny hit of sugar (never honey!) Mix of two teaspoons of white granulated sugar with one
        teaspoon of water and put it on a plate or drip it on a flower, to revive a tired bee.
        
        Make sure to always use white granulated sugar rather than other sugar. Sometimes you might see a bee lying on the
        ground and not moving, but it is probably just resting. So after you’ve given it some sugary water, just simply let it
        be(e).

        green spaces around you by downloading our bee sheet - see how many you can spot!
        </p>

        <span class="page-header">4. Eat sustainable honey</span>
        <p>
        Is honey good or bad for bees? When done right, bee farming can be beneficial for wild populations and still allow you
        to enjoy honey.
        
        When choosing honey - try to go for something local, from individual beekeepers who practice sustainability. This way
        you know where your honey is coming from and can cut down on the carbon emissions used to ship honey to your local
        supermarket.
        
        Harmful chemicals are often used in agriculture to get rid of pests in our environment. Bees can pick up these
        insecticides when they are pollinating and take them back to the hive. This causes declines in the bee populations and
        can even make it into the honey we eat! If you choose to buy organic honey you are making sure that bees are pollinating
        in pesticide free areas.
        
        Finally - eat honey less often. Even if you do all of the above, cutting honey consumption will ultimately help bee
        populations the most. There's no need to give it up completely, but just save it for an occasional treat!
